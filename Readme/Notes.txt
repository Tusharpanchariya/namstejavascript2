Javascript is Schrounues single threaded language(one commmand exectue in time in the pacific order
Part 2
How java script code run and Execute in Global space 
Call Stack-manage the gLobal Execution context in order 

Hoisting:-
Hoisting That is the show how javascript code run in order Ex.
if we Run code like --

var x =7;
function getName() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}

getName();
console.log(x);
Output--
Hello World
7
In this case when we put exection code first than the var let see what output show 
getName();
console.log(x);
var x =7;
function getName() {
    console.log("Hello World");
}

Output 
undefined(Bcz we not define the value of X before the execution code )


FUNCTIONS:-

(video 3)


function work in call stack and global execution context
 Video-4 (SHORTEST JS PROGRAM)
This == wheneever we create a execution context this is create along with that even for the funcion exeution context and that point to be a window in case of browser 
GLOBAL Space==Anything is not inside the function that is global Space
EX.
var a=1;
function b(){

var x =10;
}
in this example var a is inside global space and var b in not global space
